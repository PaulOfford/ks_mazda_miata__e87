  "description": "This is a model for the 750 MC 116 Trophy car.  It's based on an MX5 as it's the most similar standard car.
It's a work in progress and is not perfect but is closer to the real thing than the other AC models available; even closer than the BMW 1M model.
Work completed includes:<br>
<br>
* Engine power curve has been set to equate to the dyno readings for my car<br>
* Correct gear ratios, final drive and rolling tyre diameters<br>
* The LSD has been disabled<br>
* Track and wheel base are set to the 116 values - this makes the graphics image look slightly strange<br>
* Traction control defaults to off, although I think in game settings may override this<br>
* Nankang NS-2R tyres have been added as a tyre option<br>
<br>
A few notes on the above:<br>
<br>
* Although the power curve and gear ratios should be right, the car bogs own a bit where it perhaps shouldn't. An example is Nelson at Snetterton which I take in third gear in my physical car
but the model seems to struggle.<br>
* The model understeers more than it should.  I try to match the suspension set up through performance and feel rather than directly copying my race car set up.<br>
* The NS-2R tyre model is actually a copy of the semislicks used on the AC Lotus Exige.  Although I have adjusted diameters and widths, I haven't attempted to change the characterisics of the rubber - I wouldn't know where to start.<br>
<br>
Opportunities for improvement are:<br>
<br>
* Define the model so that it can sit under the BMW brand rather than as a custom configuration of an MX-5<br>
* Change the front suspension from double wishbone to strut - the handling of the model is a bit different to the real thing<br>
* Gradually align the geometry with that of a real 116 Trophy Car<br>
* Use the interior graphics from a right hand drive car<br>
